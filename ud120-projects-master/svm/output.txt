C =  10  Accuracy of RBF Kernel SVM trained with smaller size:  0.616040955631
C =  100  Accuracy of RBF Kernel SVM trained with smaller size:  0.616040955631
C =  1000  Accuracy of RBF Kernel SVM trained with smaller size:  0.821387940842
C =  10000  Accuracy of RBF Kernel SVM trained with smaller size:  0.892491467577
The largest value of C gives the best accuracy. This corresponds to a more     complex decision boundary as it sacrifices a smooth decision surface for greater    accuracy.
Accuracy of RBF Kernel with optimized C of 10000:  0.990898748578
Element 10 is classified as  1
