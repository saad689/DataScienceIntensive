    "### Examining racial discrimination in the US job market\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Discuss statistical significance.\n",

    "Based on the results above, it appears that the racial association of names does have an effect on resume callbacks. The p-value calculated is less than the significance level of 0.05. Although we can reject this null hypothesis, it should be noted that the result of this experiment do not definitively make a statement on racial discrimination. The experiment was done using black and white sounding names, which do not necessarily associate with people who are actually black or white. Also, resume callbacks do not provide indication of discrimination when the race of the person is definitively known either by self identification or by meeting and seeing the person. The result of the overall study indicates racial discrimination but does not necessarily imply causation."
